## VueJS Overview
VueJS is awesome. The end.

## Dependncies
To follow this tutorial, you will need the following tools:

- NodeJS and npm: [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Vue Cli: [Github](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)
- Vue devtools extension for Chrome or Firefox (not necessary, but recommended) [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/) / [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en)
- A text editor with with Vue syntax support. (Technically not necessary, but highly recommended - VSCode is my editor of choice with the Vetur extension installed).

## Setting Up the SPA
This application will be developed a single page application (SPA) using webpack as our build tools. Webpack can be difficulty to set up from scratch, but luckily the vue-cli provides a way to generate a webpack project that is preconfigured with VueJS.

The following command will generate a new VueJS webpack project:
``` bash
$ vue init webpack <project-name>
```

The cli will ask a few questions about the project:
- Project name: will default to the one you provided, so just hit enter
- Description: Give any description you want and hit enter
- Author: Your name goes here
- Vue build: Select `Runtime + Compiler`
- Install vue-router?: Type `Y`
- Use ESLint to lint your code?: Up to you, but `Y` is preferred
- Pick an ESLint preset: Up to you, but `Standard` is preferred
- Set up unit tests: Type `Y`
- Pick a test runner: Select `Karma and Mocha`
- Setup e2e tests with Nightwatch: Type `n`
- Run npm install?: Select `Yes, use NPM` or `Yes, use Yarn`

This will generate a new project within a directory named `<project-name>`. Once the generator has finished, go ahead and cd into the directory.

### File Structure
If you are unfamiliar with a webpack application, here are a few highlights the file structure that has been created for us.
- build: This contains the webpack config files. We won't need to touch this folder for this tutorial, but if you needed to add any modules to webpack, this is where you would do it.
- config: Project config including dev-server configuration and environment configuration.
- node_modules: This is where all of the application's dependencies are installed.
- src: This is where our application lives. This folder will contain all of our application's components and assets. We will spend almost all of our time working within this folder.
- static: This folder is where any static assets can be stored. These assets will not be pre-processed and will simply be copied as-is into our application when built.
- tests: As the name implies, all of our unit tests will go here.
- package.json: This file is where all meta-data regarding our application is defined along with where our application's dependencies are declared.
- index.html: This is our application's entry point. The vue app we develop will be embedded within this document's body tags.


### Running the dev-server
We can take a look at the application that has been generated by starting the webpack-dev-server using the following command:
``` bash
$ npm run start
```

This will start a local server on port 8080, so we can take a look at our application at http://localhost:8080. As we develop our application, webpack will detect any changes we make and will automatically reload our webpage for us - pretty slick.

To stop the server simply use `ctrl-c`


### Adding a few dependencies.
Our application has almost everything we will need, but there are a couple packages that will need to be installed. To do this will need to declare them in the `package.json` file, so go ahead and open that up and add the following within the `dependencies` object.

``` json
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "vuex": "^3.0.1",
  "axios": "^0.17.1"
}
```

Once you have saved the file, you can install these packages with either:
``` bash
$ npm install
```
or
``` bash
$ yarn install
```
Now we're all set up to begin developing our vue application!
